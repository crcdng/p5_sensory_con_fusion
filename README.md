# p5: Sensory Con-Fusion
## An Experiment Into Perceptive Disturbances

![Image](sensory_con_fusion.png)

"Sensory Fusion" is a concept in AI/robotics where inputs from multiple physical sensors are combined in order to reduce uncertainty and optimize the performance of machine perception. A typical application is in self-driving cars with real-time data from different sources such as LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), radar and infrared. Others are Internet-of-Things scenarios or the coordination of multiple robots. Usually stochastic methods such as Kalman filters or random sets are deployed. 

In Sensory Con-Fusion, data streams from different modalities disturb and irritate each other, causing a synaesthetic nightmare. The project aims to challenge the predominant technological purpose of improvement and optimization. It invites debate about related topics like information overflow, autism and neural multisensory integration.

In this sketch, audio disturbs video: **in order to see, you have to be quiet**.

Written in Processing 3 [https://processing.org/](https://processing.org/). Libraries: P5 Audio and P5 Video.  

This is still work in progress (first version made: May 3, 2017). The focus is on the conceptual not the aesthetic, and I have deliberately borrowed from the samples that come with Processing (see the sketch for details). 

This was presented during ["Multisensory Aesthetics"](https://bureaudoove.com/2017/04/24/mike-blow-multisensory-aesthetics-workshop-16th-may-2017/), a symposium organized by Dr. mike Blow at the University of Plymouth in May 2017. A [presentation](Sensory_Con_Fusion_2017.pdf) is attached.

I am also working on a VR version.

To run, copy the sketch folder into your Processing sketchbook. You might have to install libraries from the Processing GUI (`Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library`).

Make sure to read the comments in the sketch files for details and current issues.

Update (2020)
Processing is broken on Mac computers with Mac OSX Catalina. For a workaround to run this sketch in Processing 3.5.4 see:
